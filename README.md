Following Brad's tutorial on learning Bootstrap 5 and building a cool website with it! (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sosXZsdy-s).

Learned a lot about not only utilizing Bootstrap, which I really enjoy working with, but how having premade utility classes like padding and margin can dramatically speed up creating a website. Button classes, padding and margin classes, flexbox and grid, etc. Really look forward to using Bootstrap more.
